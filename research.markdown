Welcome! I'm glad you're here.

I’m a Ph.D. student in the [Hydroclimate Extremes Research Group](https://her.cee.wisc.edu/) at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, where I work under the guidance of Dr. Daniel Wright. My research focuses on the development of statistical methods for quantifying extreme precipitation , with the goal of improving our understanding of flooding events.

I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering from the University of Notre Dame in 2022. At Notre Dame, I worked with Dr. Diogo Bolster. Prior to starting my graduate studies at UW–Madison, I had the opportunity to intern at the USGS St. Petersburg Coastal and Marine Science Center, where I gained valuable experience working on workflows that measure storm surge remotely.
