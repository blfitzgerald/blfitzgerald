My research focuses on the development of a methodology for drawing statistically objective domains that are compatible with Stochastic Storm Transposition (SST). 
The methodology is outlined here:

We have run this process on three HUC4 watersheds to create transposition domains. We compare these statistically drawn domains to domains drawn by a meteorologist. 
We then run SST on both domains and compare the results.
