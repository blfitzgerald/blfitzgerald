    <p>Welcome! I'm glad you're here.</p>
    <p>I’m a Ph.D. student in the <a href="https://her.cee.wisc.edu/">Hydroclimate Extremes Research Group</a> at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, where I work under the guidance of Dr. Daniel Wright. My research focuses on the development of statistical methods for quantifying extreme precipitation, with the goal of improving our understanding of flooding events.</p>
    <p>I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering from the University of Notre Dame in 2022. At Notre Dame, I worked with Dr. Diogo Bolster. Prior to starting my graduate studies at UW–Madison, I had the opportunity to intern at the USGS St. Petersburg Coastal and Marine Science Center, where I gained valuable experience working on workflows that measure storm surge remotely.</p>
